# JustHurry Hurricane Relief Tool
Thousands were left without homes and basic resources in the wake of the devastating hurricanes that tore through Florida recently. We knew we had to dig deeper into this problem. To research this problem, we built an analysis tool using Palantir’s Foundry to pinpoint the areas most at risk of severe hurricane damage. Just then, we found out how slow and inefficient post-disaster relief efforts were. That’s when we realized something had to change. So, we created JustHurry—an intuitive platform built to expedite resource distribution and make sure the most vulnerable communities get the attention they need.

### What is JustHurry
JustHurry is a comprehensive tool that connects those in need with relief organizations ready to provide timely aid 🤝. At its core is a custom ML model 🤖 that calculates a real-time risk factor for communities based on their socioeconomic vulnerability and historical hurricane data. It uses critical variables like air pressure, wind speed, income, and population density  🌬️ to predict impact zones and determine which regions require the most attention 🚨.
